# ComputerStore
Computer Store Project Explanation
This project is an independent project that I worked on. 
This application is a computer store application. This application is written in C#. 
A customer can login to the system under a valid username and password.
The customer can then place orders for computer parts. The customer can also view computer products as well.
The store also handles furniture related to computer as well. (desk,chairs, etc..)
This application features a serialized login system. The username and password are encrypted into a binary file in the local file system.
There also is a feature to login as an admin user. 

The admin user has specialized priviledges. They are able to add customer, remove customer, add products, remove products, etc..
Under the Computer Documents sections, there is a "Screenshots" that displays screenshots of this application.
